# Limelight Cinema
##  Project Overview

I have successfully developed a dynamic cinema website from scratch, incorporating a modern and user-centric approach. The website features dynamic content that adapts based on the user's age, providing a personalized experience for every visitor. The core functionality includes:

- Dynamic Content Delivery: Using AJAX and JavaScript, the website dynamically updates content without requiring full page reloads, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

- User Registration and Login System: A secure and robust registration and login system allows users to create accounts, log in, and access personalized features. User authentication is implemented to safeguard data integrity and security.

- SQL Database Integration: All user data, cinema details, and dynamic content configurations are managed using an SQL database. This ensures efficient data storage, retrieval, and scalability for the application.

- Age-Based Content Personalization: The website identifies the user's age during registration or login and customizes the displayed content accordingly. For example, movie recommendations, ticket availability, and promotional content are tailored to suit the user's age group.

- Admin Panel: An intuitive admin panel, built with Bootstrap for a clean and professional interface, allows administrators to manage movies, user accounts, content, and website settings efficiently. The admin panel offers CRUD operations and various analytics tools to track user engagement.

- Custom Design: The website features a fully customized design for the front end, ensuring a unique and visually appealing user experience. Special attention has been given to usability and aesthetics to enhance user satisfaction.

-User Reviews: Users can add reviews for movies, providing valuable feedback and engaging with the community.

-Post Creation: Both users and administrators can create posts, such as blogs or announcements, to share information or updates.

- Commenting System: A robust commenting system enables users to add comments on posts and reviews, fostering interaction and discussion.

This project highlights my ability to integrate advanced web development techniques, such as AJAX and JavaScript, with backend systems like SQL databases. By combining custom design with functional precision, the website delivers an engaging and adaptive platform for both users and administrators.
